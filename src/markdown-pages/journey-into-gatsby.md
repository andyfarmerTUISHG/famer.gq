Catalogue and reminding myself of my journey into gatsby.

Some pre-requisites

- NVM - this is to control the version of node running
- .nvmrc will determine the version - if you don't have a function to auto check for nvm - use nvm use in the folder

## Working within the project

1. Got to your gatsby folder and run `gatsby develop`

1. To use SASS / SCSS - need to include node-sass and gatsby-plugin-sass
   - need to update gatsby-config file in the plugin section
   - make sure you import your SCSS file into your layout
